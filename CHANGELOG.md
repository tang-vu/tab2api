# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are documented here. This project follows semantic versioning while it remains in the `0.x` preview phase.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `POST /v1/images/generations` returned the chat page instead of the generated picture. The capture had the right dimensions but its contents were the edit and feedback controls, the composer, the disclaimer, and blank background, with the image itself filling only part of the frame, so the size check could not detect it. The element is now isolated from everything else on the page and the capture is clipped to exactly its box.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Local OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions, Responses, image generation, WAV speech, and UI-mediated transcription endpoints.
- Strict loopback binding, revocable per-device client keys, content-free usage counters, and bounded FIFO scheduling.
- Direct Playwright and app-managed loopback CDP browser backends.
- Tauri desktop controller with a docked dedicated Chromium window, localized settings, and in-app Cloudflare Tunnel management.
- English and Vietnamese documentation, offline CI, issue templates, security policy, and contribution guidance.

### Security

- Remote access remains optional and single-owner. Cloudflare Access is preferred; bearer-only activation requires explicit risk acceptance.
- Browser profiles, credentials, runtime data, logs, prompts, and generated artifacts remain excluded from source control.

### Limitations

- This is an unofficial browser automation preview, not the official OpenAI API and not a production or shared-service proxy.
- ChatGPT UI changes, rate limits, challenges, experiments, and account policy can interrupt operation.
- Windows desktop builds are unsigned previews; public binaries require code signing and clean-machine validation.
